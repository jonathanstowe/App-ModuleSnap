=head1 NAME

raku-module-snapshot - create a distribution to reinstall installed modules


=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code

    raku-module-snapshot [--directory=<.>]

=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This provides a simple mechanism to take a snapshot of the installed
modules for your rakudo installation as a distribution with
no installables just dependencies.

The data is collected as a META6.json in a timestamped sub-directory
of the current directory (or the directory specified on the command
line,) and you can at some later point change directory into that
directory and do

     zef install .

And the modules will be installed. You can of course copy the directory
to another machine or back it up or something.

This can be useful in two separate scenarios - firstly that you need to
do a completely fresh or side-by-side Raku installation on your
system, or you need to duplicate the installed modules from one
system on another.
